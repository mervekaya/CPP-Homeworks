In computer science, source code is any collection of computer instructions (possibly with comments) written using some human-readable 
 specifies the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by a compiler
 program into low-level machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time.
 Alternatively, an interpreter can be used to analyze and perform the outcomes of the source code program directly on the fly.
